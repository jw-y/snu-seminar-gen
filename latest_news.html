“AI For Good” Isn’t Good Enough:

A Call for Human-Centered AI
Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Sep 17, 2025

Abstract

AI for Good initiatives recognize the potential impacts of AI systems on humans and
societies. However, simply recognizing these impacts is not enough. To be truly Human-
Centered, AI development must be user-centered, community-centered, and society-centered.
User-centered design integrates techniques that consider the needs and abilities of end users,
while also improving designs through iterative user testing. Community-centered design
engages communities in the early stages of design through participatory techniques. Society-
centered design forecasts and mediates potential impacts on a societal level throughout a
project. Successful Human-Centered AI requires the early engagement of interdisciplinary
teams beyond technologists, including experts in design, the social sciences and humanities,
and domains of interest such as medicine, finance, or law, as well as community members. In
this talk, I will elaborate on my argument for an authentic Human-Centered AI while also
giving examples of this new lens to the design of applications such as autonomous driving
and aging in place.
