SNU Data Science Seminar

“AI and Control Theory
for Safety in Aviation Autonomy”

Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Apr 23, 2025
Zoom: https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/2507466555

Abstract

Decision-making in aviation involves many complex layers—from operational-level
decisions like route scheduling, to trajectory-level decisions such as air traffic control,
to vehicle-level decisions like flight stabilization. In this talk, I will focus on emerging
safety challenges across these layers and explore how tools from machine leaming and
control theory can help address them. Specifically, I will introduce two projects that
combine control-theoretic tools for safety guarantees with data-driven approaches for
ensuring safety at both the vehicle dynamics level and the air traffic control level.

First, I will introduce a safety challenge in multi-agent scenarios—known as the “leaky
comer” issue—and demonstrate how we can resolve it to achieve Safe MARL for
automated ATM by integrating MARL with safety certificate functions from control
theory. Next, I will present the concept ofa Data-Driven Hamiltonian, which integrates
data with control objectives to provide safety guarantees.

Jason Jangho Choi is a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical
Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.
He received his B.Sc in Mechanical Engineering from
Seoul National University, Korea, in 2019. His research
focuses on safety assurance for leaming-enabled
decision-making in dynamical systems, with
applications in robotics and aviation autonomy. He has
collaborated with several leading institutions in the
aviation industry, including NASA and Joby Aviation.
He was recognized as a Robotics: Science and Systems
(RSS) Pioneer in 2024.
