“Twelve Labs Founder Story:
A Journey to Build the First Industry-Grade

Video Understanding Foundation Models”
Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Apr 30, 2025
Zoom: https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/2507466555

Abstract

In this talk, 1 will share the founder's joumney behind Twelve Labs, a deep-tech startup dedicated to
train and productionize the world’s first industry-grade video understanding foundation models:
Marengo (a video embedding and retrieval model) and Pegasus (a video-language model).

Twelve Labs, founded in 2021, is a Series A startup headquartered in San Francisco and Seoul,
having raised $110M from Silicon Valley venture capitals including NEA, NVIDIA. Index
‘Ventures, Databricks, and Snowflake. The company works with major global partners such as the
NEL and MLSE, and is the first Korean-founder-led foundation model company to serve their
models on AWS Bedrock alongside Anthropic. Mistral, and Stability AI.

This talk will offer a behind-the-scenes narrative: what inspired Twelve Labs to bet on video
understanding when the AI world was largely focused on text data back in 2020. I plan to share
insights into the early technical and business challenges, motivations. and pivotal moments that
shaped Twelve Labs’ trajectory. While the session includes high-level technical overviews of the
models, it is primarily designed as a founder's perspective, not a detailed research presentation.
