SNU Data Science Seminar

“Why Humanoids Now?”

Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Jun 4, 2025
Zoom: https://snu-
Abstract

As automation accelerates in manufacturing and logistics, the demand for robots that can
collaborate with humans and handle tasks involving interaction and cooperation is rapidly
growing. In response, companies such as Boston Dynamics, Tesla, and Figure are
intensifying their efforts in humanoid robot development, drawing renewed attention to the
field. This talk explores the factors driving this resurgence by looking at key technological
advances, historical developments, and real-world applications. It will share insights on
designing human-friendly robots, with a focus on motion control and human-robot interaction
that enable safe and seamless integration into human environments. The talk also highlights
the retum of teleoperation and its significance, illustrated through recent research and
KIMLAB’s approaches. In the era of Embodied and Physical Al, this talk aims to offer a
perspective on how humanoid robots can more naturally blend into our daily lives—and why
now is the time to focus on their development and deployment.

Joohyung Kim

Joohyung Kim is an Associate Professor of ECE (Electrical and
Computer Engineering) and MechSE (Mechanical Science &
Engineering), and the director of KIMLAB (Kinetic Intelligent
Machine LAB) at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. His
research focuses on design and control for humanoid robots,
system for motion learning in robot hardware. and safe human-
robot interaction. He received BSE and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Seoul National
University, Korea, in 2001 and 2012. He was with Disney
Research as a Research Scientist from 2013 to 2019. Prior to
joining Disney. he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics
Institute at Camegie Mellon University for DARPA Robotics
Challenge in 2013. From 2009 to 2012, he was a Research Staff
Member in Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology and
Samsung Electronics, Korea, developing biped walking
controllers for humanoid robots.
