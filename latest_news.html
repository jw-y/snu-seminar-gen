SNU Data Science Seminar

“Data and AI Markets

A Data Science Perspective”
Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Oct 22, 2025

Abstract

As data and AI become central to innovation across industries. unlocking their full value remains a
grand challenge. This talk explores the emerging paradigm of data and AI markets as a
transformative approach to address the technical, economic, and societal complexities of data
sharing, model integration, and collaborative analytics. Unlike ad hoc or siloed exchanges, data and
AI markets provide scalable, systematic mechanisms for valuation, privacy preservation,
trustworthiness, and incentivization. Through real-world examples from healthcare, sustainability.
and federated learning, the talk illustrates how data ecosystems can evolve from isolated assets to
dynamic, service-oriented platforms. Drawing from recent advances in Shapley value computation,
game-theoretic valuation, and privacy-aware mechanisms, it highlights novel methods for
quantifying contribution and ensuring faimess. It also presents system-level innovations like Dealer,
which enable trustworthy. privacy-preserving marketplaces. The vision is clear: by co-designing
infrastructure, algorithms. and economic models. we can build data and AI markets that are
equitable, efficient, and impactful. This talk shares both foundational ideas and cutting-edge
developments. offering a data science perspective on how to operationalize cooperation in the age
of Al.
