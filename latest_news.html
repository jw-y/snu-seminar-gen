SNU Data Science Seminar

“Trustworthy Document AI:

From “Good Enough” to Mission-Critical”

Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Oct 29, 2025
Zoom: https://snu-ac-kr.zoom.us/j/2507466555

Abstract

Large Language Models and multimodal generative systems can now read dense contracts,
physician notes, and photographed invoices with impressive fluency. But in courtrooms,
clinics, and underwriting desks, “pretty good” still courts unacceptable risk. This talk frames
Document AI as an end-to-end product challenge: we will explore how reliable performance
emerges not from bigger models alone, but from principled evaluation and structured design.
We'll show how QA-driven metrics, especially reinforcement learning with automated
reward signals, enable scalable self-improvement and replace vague benchmarks with real-
world accountability. Agentic systems, which decompose schema-driven tasks into
orchestrated micro-agents. offer a more transparent and cost-effective path than monolithic
LLMs. Across modalities and use cases, from legal extraction to voice agents, we argue for
Document AI as infrastructure: modular, measurable, and mission-ready.

Haixun Wang is an ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow. Editor-in-
Chief of the IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, a trustee on the
board of VLDB, and an affiliate professor at the University of
Washington. He is currently the VP of Engineering and Head
of Al at EvenUp. where he focuses on leveraging LLMs and
VLMs to analyze legal and medical documents. providing
CoPilot-like support to lawyers, and enhancing demand
generation and litigation processes. Prior to EvenUp. he held
leadership roles in AI, applied science, NLP, and knowledge
bases at Instacart, WeWork, Amazon, and Meta. Before that.
he was a researcher in the labs of Microsoft. Google. and IBM.
Dr. Wang has published over 200 research papers in top
intemational journals and conference proceedings. His work
has been recognized with several prestigious awards, including
the 10-Year ICDE Influential Paper Award (2024), the ICDE
Best Paper Award (2015). the ICDM 10-Year Best Paper
Award (2013), and the Best Paper Award at ER (2009).

<p>이번 주 데이터사이언스 세미나 연사는 EvenUp의 VP of Engineering인 Haixun Wang 박사입니다. EvenUp은 샌프란시스코에 본사를 둔 AI 기반 법률 스타트업으로, 최근 기업가치가 $2B 수준까지 올랐습니다. Wang 박사는 이번 강연에서 신뢰할 수 있는 문서 AI 시스템을 구축하기 위한 기술적 및 비즈니스적 접근법을 소개합니다.<br/>Haixun Wang 박사는 UCLA에서 컴퓨터공학 박사를 받은 후 MS, Google, IBM, Meta, Amazon, WeWork, Instacart에서 Data Science, AI 연구와 사업화를 선도했습니다. 200편이 넘는 논문을 발표하였으며 이러한 경험과 공로를 인정받아 Univ of Washington에 겸직 교수로 초빙되었습니다. 작년 말 Instacart VP of Engineering에서 EvenUp의 VP 겸 Head of AI로 옮겼습니다.</p>
