SNU Data Science Seminar

“Augmenting Authority: How AI Factories and
Two-Sided Platforms Will Power the Real Economy”
Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Sep 3, 2025
Zoom: https://smu-ac-kr.zoom .us/j/2507466555

Abstract

The current AI paradigm, focused on the raw intelligence of standalone models. is hitting a fundamental
limit of cost and utility. This talk argues that the true value of AI will not be realized until it is
intrinsically linked to the authority of real-world economic actors—the businesses, institutions, and
creators who make decisions and drive outcomes. The next frontier is not artificial general intelligence,
‘but Augmented Intelligence, where AI serves to enhance the capabilities of these established players.
To enable this vision, we must first build the AI Factory. This is not merely a model-building pipeline,
‘but a foundational infrastructure designed to provide the robust, efficient, and customizable AI
capabilities that economic actors require to augment their operations. The AI Factory is the engine that
will power a new generation of Al-enabled entities.

As these augmented actors multiply, they will require a new economic framework to interact and
transact within. We propose the Platform AT, a two-sided market designed to orchestrate this new
economy. This platform will operate ona revolutionary model: it will eliminate the cost barrier for end-
users (the demand side), fostering mass adoption and creating a vibrant ecosystem. Simultaneously, it
will offer service providers (the supply side) deep, unprecedented business opportunities, giving them
compelling reasons to pay for access to build and deploy their augmented services.

This presentation will outline the architecture of this strategy, from the technical necessity of the Al
Factory to the economic principles of the two-sided Platform AI. Attendees will gain a new perspective
on Al's role—not as a replacement for human agency, but as a powerful tool for augmenting the
authority of those who shape our economy.
