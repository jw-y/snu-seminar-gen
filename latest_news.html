SNU Data Science Seminar

“Silicon Valley's Industry Landscape:

Sensor-Driven Intelligence”
Time : 09:00 - 10:30, Jun 11,2025

Abstract

This seminar begins by covering Silicon Valley's evolving industry landscape. establishing a ground
truth: we are deeply immersed in the AI era. a natural progression from the internet and mobile
revolutions that came before it. I will provide an overview on the current AI trends and deep dive
into the various AI monetization strategies shaping today's market. Based on these observations, I'm
making a bold prediction: Al's next critical frontier lies in acquiring richer, more nuanced real-world
data. From the viewpoint of a hardware system design engineer. this seminar will spotlight sensors
as essential components for bridging this data gap. They are truly the indispensable link for Al's
continued evolution and significant value creation. As examples, a few groundbreaking innovations
in sensor design, data acquisition, and edge processing will be explored at a high level and with
minimal jargon. Tl show how these advancements across various fields—from everyday consumer
applications to sophisticated biomedical devices—are enabling a continuous flow of high-quality.
contextualized data. This real-time and high quality stream of information is what's needed to train
the next generation of robust and truly intelligent AI models. Beyond a simple lecture style seminar,
this session is designed for open discussion and collaborative exploration. My goal is to
collaboratively identify and prepare for the strategic directions that will define the era after AI with
audiences.
