“Training LLMs for (Multi-Agent)

Sequential Decision Making”

Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, yet their training
paradigm—based on next-token prediction—misaligns with the sequential and interactive nature of
real decision-making. This talk explores how LLMs can be understood, evaluated, and trained as
sequential decision-makers within online leaming and multi-agent game-theoretic frameworks. In
the first part, we introduce the notion of regret as a quantitative measure of decision quality and
investigate whether LLM agents exhibit no-regret behavior across stochastic, adversarial, and multi-
player environments. Empirical results show that pre-trained LLMs often approximate Follow-the-
Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) dynamics—achieving near no-regret performance—while certain
counterexamples reveal structural limitations. We then present the Regret-Loss framework, a novel
training objective that provably yields no-regret behavior in transformer architectures. Theoretical
results connect this loss to generalization guarantees and show that single-layer self-attention
networks naturally leam Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) updates under this loss. In the
second part, we extend this perspective to multi-agent reinforcement leaning. proposing MAPoRL
(Multi-Agent Post-Co-Training with RL) for collaborative LLM systems. Through verifier-based
reward shaping and multi-agent PPO, MAPoRL enhances inter-agent cooperation and performance
on benchmarks such as GSM8K and ANLI. even under cross-domain transfer. Together, these
results establish a unified view of LLMs as adaptive. interactive learners, offering both theoretical
insights and practical pathways toward training language-based agents with provable decision-
making guarantees.
